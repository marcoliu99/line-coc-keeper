"""Per-conversation locks so two messages for the same conversation can't race
on data/groups/*.json.

app/state.py does a full read-modify-write (load_state -> mutate -> save_state)
with no locking of its own. Without serialization, two events for the same
conversation arriving close together can each load the same on-disk snapshot,
mutate their own in-memory copy, and save — the second save silently discards
whatever the first one wrote (e.g. an HP/SAN change from a skill check that
happened "at the same time" as another player's).

"Conversation" here is a platform-agnostic id — a LINE group/room/user, a
Discord channel, whatever an adapter in app/main.py or app/discord_bot.py
addresses one GroupState by (see app/commands.py, which namespaces these as
"line-group-...", "discord-channel-...", etc. to keep platforms from colliding).

The fix here is coarse but correct: one asyncio.Lock per conversation_id, held
for the entire duration of handling one message (from the initial load_state
through every save_state it triggers, including while awaiting a slow Keeper
LLM call). Different conversations still run fully concurrently — only messages
within the same conversation queue up behind each other.
